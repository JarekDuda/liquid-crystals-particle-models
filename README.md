Exploring resemblance between topological defects in liquid crystals and particle physics - gathered links and sources
Jarek Duda, 2022

Basic idea (Manfried Faber): define curvature of liquid-crystal-like field as EM field, this way Gauss law counts topological charge - leading to electromagnetism with built-in charge quantization, also repairing the problem of infinite energy of point charge.
