Exploring resemblance between topological defects in liquid crystals and particle physics - gathered links and implementations. 
Jarek Duda, 2022

Basic idea ([Manfried Faber](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/2/73/htm), [agreement with running coupling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13374)): define curvature of liquid-crystal-like field as EM field, this way Gauss law counts topological charge - leading to electromagnetism with built-in charge quantization, also repairing the problem of infinite energy of point charge.
